<img width="1298" alt="image" src="https://github.com/YanYuanFE/stark-airdrop/assets/17774285/dc075ee8-f6eb-4479-b4d2-869883e676e8">


Since the official airdrop page of Starknet only supports argent and braavos wallets, users using okx wallet and metamask snap cannot claim their airdrops, and the official website needs to queue up to claim airdrops due to excessive traffic, and the claiming time is very long. Therefore, we based on the official Airdrop document: https://github.com/starknet-io/provisions-data/tree/main, developed this application to quickly receive airdrops. It supports all starknet wallets, including okx and metamask snap, and can claim any on behalf of others. The airdrop of the address is received directly from the official contract. All codes are completely open source and there are no security risks.
